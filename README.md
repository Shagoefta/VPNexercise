Setting up a VPN server


After doing some research I tried to set up a VPN server using the information I found on several websites. Even though I did not manage yet to make the server work, I have learned a lot while going through the steps. In the PDF file in this repository you will find a log of all the steps I went through. Doing this exercise made me more familiar with keys and certificates. I also learned the importance of the EPEL package. I would still like to make the VPN server work, so my research will continue.
